# Visual-Surveillance

Railway Level Crossing Monitoring 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

develop a visual surveillance system that correctly identifies each of the following events that may occur on the railway level crossing:
1. the railway track is not clear of road/pedestrian traffic
2. a road vehicle is entering the railway line crossing
3. a road vehicle is leaving the railway line crossing
4. the level crossing safety barrier is deployed
5. rail traffic is currently using the railway track
6. no events

The system is implemented using OpenCV.
